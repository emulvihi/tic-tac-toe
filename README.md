## Testing

As of this moment, testing was done mainly to correct errors and fix bugs created/found during the build

## Deployment

The website was built using the Cloud9 IDE, version control was done using a local Git directory which was then pushed to Github using Ubuntu/ Bash. It was then made live using Github Pages by navigating to the settings tab in the site's GitHub repository, scrolling to the GitHub Pages section and selecting the master branch as the source in the dropdown menu. and can be seen at: https://emulvihi.github.io/tic-tac-toe/.

If you wish to view or edit the site's files locally, navigate to the GitHub repository of the site, click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the link shown. In a terminal window, navigate to the local directory where you want to clone the repository. Once there type the command "$ git clone https://github.com/emulvihi/tic-tac-toe.git".
