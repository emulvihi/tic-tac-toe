# Tic Tac Toe Javascript Project

A game of tic-tac-toe that is unbeatable by a human player. The computer player makes use of the minimax algorithm in order to determine the most advantageous move. Players may be able to achieve a draw but cannot beat the computer.

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://emulvihi.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) Repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/emulvihi/tic-tac-toe)

## Problems Encountered

There were a large range of problems encountered during this project but the main one was time. This project had two other iterations before I finally decided on what I was going to do; the first of these was an interactive map and the second was a game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. I ultimately deemed them too complex and time-consuming, however not before wasting significant time on them given my limited timescale of a week in which to complete this project.

Being unfamiliar with JavaScript before this course, I made a large amount of mistakes during the build and it took a significant amount of time to correct them. In the end, I managed to achieve core functionality but failed to implement meaningful UX and greater interactivity within the timescale given. I fully intend to continue work on this project in order to fully flesh it out and complete it to my satisfaction.

All in all, this project was a good exercise in learning to determine what is feasible and choosing what features are core to a project and must be kept vs. extraneous ones.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5
   - Basic structure and layout of site
2. CSS3
   - Basic styling of site
3. Javascript
   - Used to create the game and implement the minimax algorithm
4. [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
   - Used for pushing the project from a local Git repository to Github
5. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
   - Used for pushing the project from a local Git repository to Github
6. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for version control
7. [Github](https://github.com/)
    - Used as public repository for site and to push site live on Github Pages
8. [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/login)
    - Used as the development environment for the site
9. [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
    - Used to live test style changes and test site on a variety of screen sizes

## Testing

As of this moment, testing was done mainly to correct errors and fix bugs created/found during the build

## Deployment

The website was built using the Cloud9 IDE, version control was done using a local Git directory which was then pushed to Github using Ubuntu/ Bash. It was then made live using Github Pages by navigating to the settings tab in the site's GitHub repository, scrolling to the GitHub Pages section and selecting the master branch as the source in the dropdown menu. and can be seen at: https://emulvihi.github.io/tic-tac-toe/.

If you wish to view or edit the site's files locally, navigate to the GitHub repository of the site, click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the link shown. In a terminal window, navigate to the local directory where you want to clone the repository. Once there type the command "$ git clone https://github.com/emulvihi/tic-tac-toe.git".
